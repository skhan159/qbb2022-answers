Really good work, Sebastian. One small comment: in your python script, it looks like a lot of your code is out of order. My assumption is that you made the plots one at a time, and then commented out the sections for the plots you already made. That's generally fine, but if you do that, make sure you keep the code in an order where IF the code were all uncommented, it would still work as expected. As it stands right now, it wouldn't work quite right (e.g. your PCA plots would both be post-processing) (no points deducted)
