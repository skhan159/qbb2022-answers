#Part 1
dCTCF - 92%
ddCTCF - 88%
ddCTCF makes up the majority, they are dangling end pairs
#Part 2
The highlighted difference found in the paper is not recapitulated in the graphs I made.
Higher sequencing depth allows greater definition in the TAD structure and resulting graph.
The greater the signal power the stronger the interaction between those TADs.
