# Week 3 Variant Calling -- Feedback

1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9 points out of 10 possible points

1. Index genome

  * --> +1

2. align reads

  * fantastic use of one for loop for questions 2 and 3! --> +1

3. sort bam files and index sorted bam files (0.5 points each)

  * --> +1

4. variant call with freebayes

  * ploidy should be 1 for this yeast data
  * good overall --> +1

5. filter variants

  * good! --> +1

6. decompose complex haplotypes

  * great! --> +1

7. variant effect prediction

  * what code did you use for this? --> +0

8. python plotting script

  * good --> +1

9. 4 panel plot (0.25 points each panel)

  * good plot overall! consider using a rotation for the tick labels for the variant effects so that they don't overlap, something like `plt.xticks(rotation = 45)` --> +1

10. 1000 line vcf

  * --> +1
