## Week 5 -- 10 points possible

1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1  = 10 points out of 10

1. Filter reads, Call peaks, and intersect peaks across Sox2 replicates (0.33 points each)

2. Find the number of total peaks and overlapping peaks for Klf4 and Sox2 (0.5 for commands, 0.5 for result)

3. scale bedgraph files (4 different datasets, 0.25 each)

4. crop bedgraph files (4 different datasets, 0.25 each)

5. python script for plotting


6. 4 panel plot of read pile ups
* Nice use of the tick marks and tick mark labels so that we can see the different scales. Most would prefer using the same scale/max value for all four subplots.
* I know from the code you used `plot()` for all of them, but from the figure itself, it looks like you only used `plot` for one of them? It's the only one with a line/curve. The rest look like really thin bars or a histogram
* you can use the [fill_between matplotlib function](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.fill_between.html) to fill in the curves if you want


7. motif finding sort intersected sox2 replicate narrow peak by 5th columm, keep first 300 lines, awk command for reformatting (0.33 each)

8. use samtools faidx to extract peak sequences and meme-chip to perform motif finding (0.5 each)

9. download and unpack motif database

* code for having done this? I see that you have based off of the tomtom command; just please record such things

10. match profiles from tomtom for klf4 and sox2 (0.5 for commands, 0.5 for result)

Great work overall!
