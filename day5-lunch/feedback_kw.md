I don't think the names for the input data in python match with the order of the columns from the data wrangling in Unix. Please go back through and make sure that you are accurate and consistent.


I like the single scatter plot that shows both sets of data on one plot! Sadly, the labels don't match with my expectations. The father data should have the higher number of DNMs overall. This would be explained by switching the names for the input data within the python array such that they don't match the order they are in the input file.


Again, the labels don't match with my expectations for the histogram. The father data should have the number of DNMs overall. Again, I think the input data/names mismatch is to blame.


I didn't go through the rest of the assignment because the conclusions are based off of incorrect data input.
