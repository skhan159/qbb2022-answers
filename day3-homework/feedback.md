Overall this looks good. You plotting code looks good and your plots look correct. I especially appreciated that you put your PCA plots as subpanels in the same plot. While not required, it is nice if you include the commands you ran on the command line to do these data manipulations. Think of it as showing your work. Also, it's worth toying with formatting when plotting when you have issues like a legend covering data. But all in all, well done. Keep it up!
